# BirdHouse README (Work in progress!)

BirdHouse is a mobile birdwatching companion app aimed at making birdwatching fun and accessible for beginners.

## Motivation

Birdwatching can be very intimidating for a burgeoning birder and many reference guides are bulky and can be difficult to use if you don't know exactly what you are looking for. BirdHouse was created as a way for a beginner to quickly look up birds that they see while out walking/hiking.
